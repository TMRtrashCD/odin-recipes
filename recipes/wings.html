    <h2>Description</h2>
        <main>Juicy, salty, and delicious. There is a reason people keep coming back to this classic American dish. Other cooking methods simply cannot compare to the all-encapsulating method of frying food in fat. Making wings is easy (if you can get past the not-so-easy method of frying) and you will not be disappointed.</main>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sectioned Chicken Wings</li>
            <li>Oil for Frying (Canola, Peanut, Etc, something high smokepoint)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>A sauce or dry seasoning</li>
            <li>Buttermilk for brining (Optional. A Brine will greatly help the meaty be evenly seasoned and moist, but is not needed.)</li>    
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour oil into wok, or a heavy duty frying pot or pan. Oil should be enough to cover wings, although keep in mind you will only be frying about 5 at a time. Cook on medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Season wings with salt. I recommend brineing in a bath of buttermilk and pickle juice or salt, but this is optional.</li>
            <li>Once oil is at *incert ideal frying temp* degrees, carefully drop in chicken by hand.</li>
            <li>Fry until skin is crispy, and meat is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Drop wings into a large bowl, and coat with sauce or seasonings. Toss to combine. Eat immediately, and no judgement if you eat from the bowl.</li>
        </ol>
