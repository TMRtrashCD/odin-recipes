    <h2>Description</h2>
        <main>This is a smashburger. Crunchy, juicy, and well-salted, a smash burger is reveled for the crispy carmelized layer it provides on the beef. Thick burgers simply cannot develop the type of crust that a smashed burger can. Also, by using 80/20 beef (heck, even 70/30 is great), you do not have to be concerned with the burger being dry. You can cook a smash burger in more than half the time it would take you to cook a thicker patty. A smash burger is perfect for lunches, dinners, parties where you don't want to be concerned about undercooking the meat, and more. This recipe will show you that all you need to make a smash burger is a heavy skillet (cast iron prefered), meat, and something to smash it with.</main>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Brioche Bun</li>
            <li>80/20 Ground Beef</li>
            <li>American Sliced Cheese</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper to Taste</li>
            <li>Canola Oil (Only if your Cast Iron Pan is not well seasoned)</li>
            <li>Any condiments if want. I recommend something acidic, like katchup and onions.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Set your pan over the highest heat setting. Allow it to come to temp. An optional step which may help develop a deeper crust, is to set the pan over a lower heat, or in the oven, for about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll your meat into two 3.5-4oz balls. Be sure to not handle your meat too roughly.</li>
            <li>Once the pan is smoking, add your meat (add canola first if needed) to the pan one ball at a time. Using a strong spatula or something heavy and flat, smash the meat into the pan. You should smash strongly all the way to the edges, so the edges of the meat are very thin.</li>
            <li>Add any salt and pepper to the back side. Season with salt well.</li>
            <li>After 2-3 minutes, in one quick motion scrape up the pattys. Flip. Add cheese and allow to cook on the other side for 1 minute and remove from pan once cooked fully.</li>
            <li>Add buns to the pan to toast.</li>
            <li>Stack burger, enjoy.</li>

            </ol>
